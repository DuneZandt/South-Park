        <h3>Trey Parker</h3>
        <div class="container">
        <p> Trey Parker was born on October 19, 1969 in Conifer, Colorado. His mother was an insurance saleswoman named Sharon, and his father was a geologist named Randolph “Randy” Parker II. He also had a sister named Shelley, who liked to beat him up. Does this sound familiar? Well, if you’re somewhat educated on the show and the character Stan Marsh, then you’d realize that this information mirrors him. This is because when Stan Marsh was created, he was meant to be based off of Trey as a kid. Of course, this has changed somewhat over the years, which I will discuss on the character page of this website. The character’s dad is directly based off of Trey’s, even down to his occupation. This is the same with Shelley Marsh, Stan’s sister. Stan’s mom is a little different, since Trey’s mom was described as “more like Cartman’s mom, but without the pr*stitution.” Sharon (the character) works as a receptionist at Tom’s Rhinoplasty (a plastic surgery hospital) instead of as an insurance saleswoman. Stan also shares the same birthday as Trey.<br><br>
        Trey Parker was a shy kid who had dreams to pursue a career in film and music. He’d had this interest for writing sketches and creating comedy from a young age. When he was just in sixth grade, he wrote one of his first sketches ever- “The Dentist.” He performed it in his school’s talent show. “I played the dentist, and I had my friend play a patient. It was sort of: ‘What could go wrong at the dentist?’ I just remember I had lots of fake blood and everything. Finally, his head explodes. My parents got a call from the school; they were really upset. The kindergarteners were all crying and freaking out,” Trey Parker had stated in an interview.<br><br>
        He started consistently making short films and sketches with his friends at 14. They would continue making films until graduation. At 17, he began having an interest in music too. He’d write and record a full comedy album called <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL61BD3B590860B132&si=yYj5D_fUSIIxnqwY">Immature: A Collection of Love Ballads for the 80’s Man</a>, with his friend David Goodman. Trey Parker developed a love for musical theater and joined the Evergreen Players (a community theater outside of Denver.) He attended highschool at Evergreen High and worked a part-time job at Pizza Hut. He quickly became a popular kid, often getting lead roles in plays and getting picked as prom king. He was described as “a film geek and a music buff”.</p>

        <p class="gah">He graduated from high school in 1988, then spent a semester at Berklee College of Music before transferring to the University of Colorado at Boulder. He took a film class that required the students to collaborate with others, and it was here where he met Matt Stone. They both shared an interest in provocative, anti-authoritarian humor and Monty Python, and soon enough, became friends.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: SouthPark;">Matt Stone</h3>
        <div class="container2">
        <img src="Mattphoto.jpg" class="image2">
        <p>Matt was born on May 26, 1971 in Houston, Texas. His father was named Gerald Whitney Stone and he worked as an economic professor, and his mom was Sheila Lois, who was unemployed. His dad was of Irish-American heritage while his mother was of Jewish heritage. Similar to how Stan Marsh mirrors Trey, Kyle Broflovski mirrors Matt. Kyle’s parents were named after Stone’s parents. Matt Stone also had a younger sister named Rachel, and together they were raised in Littleton, Colorado, where they went to Heritage High School. He was also interested in music, similar to how Trey was, but couldn’t pursue it due to his dad.<br><br>
            There isn’t much else information on Matt. Unlike Trey, he doesn’t talk much in detail about his childhood, and neither do his parents. This doesn’t mean it was necessarily bad, he just doesn’t give out that much information.</p>
